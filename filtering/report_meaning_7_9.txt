False is good, True is bad

sequence always refers to the consensus sequence made from 1 or more samples

an INDEL or bad read is defined as a '-' or 'n' that appears on any sequence, unless a '-' appears on all three


1: recomb_node_id
2: donor_node_id
3: acceptor_node_id
4: should check - boolean flag

    True if any of the other boolean flags are true

5: Not enough acceptor matches - boolean flag

    True if pre_b1_skew <= 0 and post_b2_skew <= 0

6: Not enough donor matches - boolean flag

    True if btw_b1_b2_skew <= 0

7: Unnecessary breakpoint - boolean flag

    True if (pre_b1_skew < 0 and post_b2_skew > 0) or (pre_b1_skew > 0 and post_b2_skew < 0)

8: pre_b1_skew - integer

    Number of good mutations the recombinant has in common with the acceptor,
    minus the number of good mutations the recombinant has in common with the donor,
    in the region before breakpoint 1,
    where a good mutation is one that is at least 2 bp away from any INDEL or bad read on all three sequences.

9: btw_b1_b2_skew - integer

    Number of good mutations the recombinant has in common with the donor,
    minus the number of good mutations the recombinant has in common with the acceptor,
    in the region between breakpoint 1 and 2,
    where a good mutation is one that is at least 2 bp away from any INDEL or bad read on all three sequences.

10: post_b2_skew - integer

    Number of good mutations the recombinant has in common with the acceptor,
    minus the number of good mutations the recombinant has in common with the donor,
    in the region after breakpoint 2,
    where a good mutation is one that is at least 2 bp away from any INDEL or bad read on all three sequences.

11: Too many mutations near INDELs - boolean flag

    True if 6 or more mutations are less than 2 bp away from an INDEL or bad read,
    or if 1 or more mutations are exactly on an INDEL or bad read,
    or if a mutation is at most 5 bp away from an INDEL or bad read with a size of at least 5 bp

12: Mutations close to INDELs - natural number

    Number of mutations which are less than 2 bp away from an INDEL or bad read on all three sequences.

13: Mutations on INDELs - natural number

    Number of mutations which are exactly on an INDEL or bad read on all three sequences.

14: Suspicious mutation clump - boolean flag

    True if theres a stretch of 20 bps with 6 or more mutations on a single sequence,
    or if theres a stretch of 20 bps with 3 or more mutations on a single sequence and one is at most 5 bp away from an INDEL or bad read with a size of at least 10 bp.

15: Mutations clumped - natural number

    Most mutations in any stretch of 20 bps on a single sequence

16: Clump site - alignment coordinate

    Closing point of the stretch of 20 bps which contained the most mutations

17: Clump in - string

    Which sequence had the most mutations in any stretch of 20 bps on a single sequence

18: Size of INDEL near clump - natural number

    Width of INDEL or bad read thats at most 5 bp away from the stretch of 20 bps which contained the most mutations.

19: Informative sites clump - boolean flag

    True if theres a stretch of 20 bps with 6 or more informative sites on any sequence.

20: Informative sites clumped - natural number

    Most informative sites in any stretch of 20 bps on any node

21: Site of informative sites clump - alignment coordinate

    Closing point of the stretch of 20 bps which contained the most informative sites

22: INDEL in the wrong region - boolean flag

    True if a large INDEL does not appear in the recombinant, and
        it does appear in the acceptor, when in the region before breakpoint 1, or
        it does appear in the donor, when in the region between breakpoints 1 and 2, or
        it does appear in the acceptor, when in the region after breakpoint 2
    a large INDEL is defined as a stretch of 11 bps which are either '-' or 'n', centered around a mutation

23: breakpoint-1_interval
24: breakpoint-2_interval
25: original_parsimony
26: min_starting_parsimony
27: recomb_parsimony
28: rob_pval
29: russ_pval
30: Parsimony change rank

    If you order all possible recombinant events by change in parsimony, this is the rank of the event with these three nodes
