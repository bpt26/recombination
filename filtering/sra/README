This directory is where raw reads are retrieved and stored to be manually examined 

The following command retrieves a raw read
------------------------------------------

./getandpack [Accession]
	
	This will retrieve the raw reads from the sra database,
	It will align those raw reads to the reference,
	And then produce a bam and bam index for those reads
